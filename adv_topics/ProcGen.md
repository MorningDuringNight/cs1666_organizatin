# Procedural Generation Advanced Topic Presentations

Before your presentation, use this file to get your talk outline approved. Be
sure to provide an estimated time to spend on teach topic (totaling 45 minutes)
and be sure not to repeat any topics covered in previous presentations.

# Team3 Procedural Generation

## What is Procedural Generation? (13 min)

- **Basic explanation of what makes it different from pure randomness (2 min)** `Ryan`
  - There is logic to it
  - Not just complete random generation
  - Tetris (completely random)
  - Pokemon Spawns (lottery style)

- **Examples from different games**
  - Subway surfers (1 min) `Ryan`
    - Segments chosen from pool, filtered by rules
      - no repeats, match connectors, fit difficulty
  - Deep Rock Galactic (1 min) `Ryan`
    - Pre-designed cave chunks
    - Constructive Solid Geometry to cut out or add volumes
  - No Man’s Sky (3 min) `Ryan`
    - Superformula used to create organic looking shapes
    - Fractals
  - Minecraft (4 min) `Lucas`
    - Perlin noise overview
    - Fractal noise intro (will go in more detail during explanation of our implementation)
  - Hades (2 min) `Lucas`
    - Similarities to our generation
    - Predesigned rooms with random enemies and rewards
    - Different order of rooms
    - BSP overview

## Our Implementation (4 mins)

- **Scope of procedural generation in Cleanup Crew** `Lucas`
  - Air pressure generated by Fractal noise
  - Rooms being placed with BSP, hallways generating to connect them
  - Enemies are placed and scaled based on distance.
- **How will Procedural Generation impact our game?** `Lucas`
  - Replayability
  - Dynamic difficulty scaling
  - Emergent gameplay
- **What makes this an advanced topic?** `Lucas`
  - Algorithm complexity
  - Mathematical foundations
  - Difficult to debug

## Our Perlin Noise implementation (code overview) (10 min) `William`

- Basic perlin noise vs fractal noise
- Different files and their responsibilities
  - `noise.rs`
    - Fractal Brownian Noise: stacking multiple perlin noise maps to create more organic detail.
    - (show code) uses of the variables **scale**, **octaves**, **gain**, and **lacunarity** and how they affect the noise map
    - Helper functions that normalize values, combine the octaves, and remap the outputs of the map to usable ranges for the fluid dynamics simulation
  - `air.rs`
    - `AirGrid` struct that represents the game as a 2D grid where each tile stores the air pressure and obstacle data.
    - Grid size, pressure, obstacles: grid dimensions come from the map, pressure values come from the perlin noise, and obstacles are mapped to solid tiles like walls and doors.
    - `init_air_grid`
    - Explain how the range for the RNG was decided for variables like scale, gain, and lacunarity.
    - How does it know where to put a pressure value and where not to
    - What about space

## Binary Space Partition room generation + Hallway generation (15 min) `Ansel`

- What is the basic concept of BSP
- Explain the tree and why we would store rooms in it
- What are some ways we can generate hallways
  - Traveling down from the root and using connections within the tree to build hallways between branches
  - Using an array of all terminal leaves sorted by center points and connecting to neighbors
- We are trying different ways of generating hallways—discuss these methods and why we choose what we choose
- Explanation of the issue we had with turning hallways and our solution (adding walls at the very end so only floor tiles are calculated)
- Code walkthrough and example run to generate a map

## Enemy Generation (3 min) `Ryan`

- How the enemies scale in difficulty as player progresses
- Further the room the more enemies
- Increase the number of enemies and maybe damage/health?
